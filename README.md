# GGCS
Writeups for the GGCS CTF that happened between 20th and 21st of May

I ended up 100%ing this CTF, so I thought I would make some writeups(or at least attempt to)
Please note, I had to rush the heck out of these in order to have them done for when the CTF was over (especially binary)

# Thoughts on the CTF
Initially I wasn't expecting too much from this CTF, because the boundary for qualification was set quite low, only a single challenge from level 6 HQ was required for qualification.
However, I was proved wrong quite quickly after looking at the web challenges.
These challenges definitely taught me a lot, and I definitely have a few personal favourites, like WH01 (no space command injection) or BX03(simple ROPchain)
Thank you to all the people over at GGCS who made this CTF a really nice experience for me, and I hope my writeups are good enough at explaining each challenge.
