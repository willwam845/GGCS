Download the file at https://ggcs-files.allyourbases.co/ce01.zip and solve the cipher to get the flag.

Note: The flag is in uppercase like THIS.

If we download this file, we see a lot of text.

We can try multiple things on it, I found that cracking it with a substitution solver did the trick!
`https://www.guballa.de/substitution-solver`
Giving the output of 
```
IN CRYPTOGRAPHY, A SUBSTITUTION CIPHER IS A METHOD OF ENCRYPTING BY WHICH UNITS OF PLAINTEKT ARE REPLACED WITH CIPHERTEKT, ACCORDING TO A FIKED SYSTEM; THE "UNITS" MAY BE SINGLE LETTERS (THE MOST COMMON), PAIRS OF LETTERS, TRIPLETS OF LETTERS, MIKTURES OF THE ABOVE, AND SO FORTH. THE RECEIVER DECIPHERS THE TEKT BY PERFORMING THE INVERSE SUBSTITUTION. THE FLAG IS ASIMPLESUBSTITUTION
```
which gives us our flag!
Flag: ASIMPLESUBSTITUTION

Again, we have a lot of text

This again just becomes trying multiple things until something works, I found that decrypting it with ROT13 or Caesar Cipher with key 9 worked and gave us our plaintext.
```
IN CRYPTOGRAPHY, A CAESAR CIPHER, ALSO KNOWN AS CAESAR'S CIPHER, THE SHIFT CIPHER, CAESAR'S CODE OR CAESAR SHIFT, IS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND MOST WIDELY KNOWN ENCRYPTION TECHNIQUES. IT IS A TYPE OF SUBSTITUTION CIPHER IN WHICH EACH LETTER IN THE PLAINTEXT IS REPLACED BY A LETTER SOME FIXED NUMBER OF POSITIONS DOWN THE ALPHABET. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH A LEFT SHIFT OF 3, D WOULD BE REPLACED BY A, E WOULD BECOME B, AND SO ON. THE METHOD IS NAMED AFTER JULIUS CAESAR, WHO USED IT IN HIS PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE. THE FLAG IS CAESARROTSTHEBRAIN.
```
Giving us our flag!
Flag: CAESARROTSTHEBRAIN

# CE03
```
Download the file at https://ggcs-files.allyourbases.co/ce03.zip and solve the cipher to get the flag.

Note: The cipher is some form of AES encryption.
